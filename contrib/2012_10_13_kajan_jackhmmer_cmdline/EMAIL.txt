Subject: Feature Suggestion with Patch

Dear Sean!

I am Laszlo Kajan from Burkhard Rost's lab, bioinformatician, Debian maintainer.

I would like to use jackhmmer to search a smaller database to build up an HMM, and then search a bigger database with this model. The present
version of jackhmmer (that I know of, 3.0-4 in Debian) does not support this fully, because:

1: jackhmmer can not be started from a query /and/ a model, so I can not use the checkpoint model to restart it on the big database.

2: hmmsearch can not be started from a model /and/ a query, so that it would produce an alignment including the query as jackhmmer does; it also
can not do iterative search.

3: jackhmmer saves the checkpoint HMM /before/ doing another iteration, therefore in order to get the checkpoint for 3 iterations I have to run
actually 4. I would like to save those clock cycles.

I have prepared patches that solve 1 and 3 and allow me to search the big database with a model built on the smaller one, using jackhmmer
(patches attached, series: jackhmmer_chkhmmstop, jackhmmer_restartfromhmm, jackhmmer_stop_restart_test). The results obtained from the restarted
search are identical to a non-restart, when performed on the same database, i.e. 3 iterations on a database give the same results as one
iteration starting from a checkpoint HMM saved before the 3rd iteration. This make me hope that my patches - though I do not have much knowledge
about the internals of hmmer3 - are on the right path.

* Please comment on my patches and let me know if my approach is all right.

* Please consider adding the features (1 and 3) to hmmer in your next release.

Â If you do approve my patches (or something with similar results), then I would like to include them in the Debian release of hmmer3. However
this should only be a temporary solution, until your next release.

Please treat my feature suggestion and patches as a sign of my great appreciation of hmmer3. Thank you for releasing hmmer3 under a free
software license.

HMMER 3.2 release notes    (Aug 2017)
Previous release was 3.1b2 (Mar 2015)
http://hmmer.org
________________________________________________________________

Larger changes:

* HMMER is now distributed under the BSD license, instead of the GPL.

* 'make install' streamlined. Now we install only programs and man
  pages, for 18 HMMER programs and 22 Easel miniapps.  We don't
  install development .h headers or .a libraries.

* We changed our default policy on the number of threads/cores that
  the search programs use. Previously multithreaded programs would use
  all available cores by default; now we use two worker threads by
  default (~2 cores), if multiple cores are available. HMMER3 search
  programs do not scale much beyond 2 cores anyway, due to input
  saturation and memory use.

Other, smaller new features include:

* improved documentation of --mxfile and score matrix file format
* adds support for EBI's "uncheck all hits" on jackhmmer web site
* improves configure script's detection of SIMD vector support
* configuration now robust against someone running gnu `autoheader`
* removed experimental hmmbuild --seq_weights_r and --seq_weights_e options
* clarified A2M format parse error when file contains 'O' residue 
* appeased new gcc6 --Wmisleading-indentation warning
* SSI indexing is now robust against duplicate keys
* improved autoconf test for DAZ,FTZ x86 chip support
* improved autodetection of A2M vs. aligned FASTA format
* improved autodetection of phylip interleaved vs sequential format
* improved portability to Intel/Solaris
* FASTA parser now ignores description line after a ctrl-A; NCBI NR db 
  has description "lines" of up to 2.7MB.
* MSAs output with -A option now include name, acc, desc, author markup.
* In Easel miniapps, esl-translate replaces previous (buggy) esl-stranslate.
* Easel miniapps include a new esl-alirev tool, for reverse
  complementing an RNA/DNA alignment
* nhmmer/nhmmscan now allow alignments as target dbs
* target relentropy for DNA models changed from 0.45 to 0.62


Bugfixes include:

* nhmmer was corrupted by * symbols in input sequence
* nhmmscan faulted on old model files because it expected MAXL field
* --cut-ga wasn't checking that GA line was actually present in model
* GA thresholds weren't being captured from DNA/RNA Stockholm alignments
* A2M alignment parsing was corrupted on lines ending in insertions
* alphabet-guessing failed for FASTA seq >4096 bytes and <4000 residues
* genbank to fasta format conversion was leaving extra \n in accession
* NCBI db format: multithreaded nhmmer was failing to read
* NCBI db format: 1st database sequence was skipped for second query (#e6)
* unit test failures in esl_normal, esl_random due to floating point math

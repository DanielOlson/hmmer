Interim notes for upcoming 3.1 release
so stuff doesn't get forgotten that needs to be noted...


Small changes that nonetheless affect output:
(watch out for, if you are running regression tests)

-:- Multiple alignment outputs now always include all consensus
    columns, even if that column is all gaps. This simplifies
    downstream processing for a lot of people's parsers, who may be
    expecting to be able to map a query's consensus coordinate system
    unambiguously onto a new alignment.
 
    The hmmalign --allcol option (which did the above as an option)
    has been removed.

    To get the original behavior, you can use esl-reformat --mingap to
    remove all-gap columns from an alignment.

-:- The "bias" score values in all output formats, for both
    per-sequence and per-domain outputs, were erroneously
    reported in nat units in 3.0, whereas all other scores are
    bit scores. 3.1 now corrects this; the bias values
    are in units of bits.

Brief installation instructions for HMMER @RELEASE@
SRE, Sun Aug  5 16:22:52 2001
------------------------------------------

For a source distribution (hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar.gz):

 uncompress hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar.gz  Uncompresses the archive.
 tar xf hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar         Unpacks the archive. 
                                    (makes a new directory, hmmer-@RELEASE@)
 cd hmmer-@RELEASE@                 Moves into the distribution directory.
 ./configure                   Configures the software for your system.
 make                          Builds the binaries. 
 make check                    Runs the test suite to test the new binaries.
 make install                  Installs the software. (You may need to be root.)
 It should build cleanly on just about any UNIX machine.

For a binary distribution (hmmer-@RELEASE@.bin.<platform>-<os>.tar.gz),
for example, the sun-solaris distro:

    uncompress hmmer-@RELEASE@.bin.sun-solaris.tar.Z
    tar xf hmmer-@RELEASE@.bin.sun-solaris.tar
    cd hmmer-@RELEASE@
    ./configure
    make install

    Note that "make" and "make check" aren't necessary, since you
    have a precompiled distribution.

    If your machine doesn't have a C compiler, the ./configure will
    fail, and you won't be able to do a "make install". This is
    an artifact of the way I have the configure script built.
    If this happens, just copy the man pages and binaries whereever
    you want them, for instance:

    cp Man/*      /usr/local/man/man1/
    cp binaries/* /usr/local/bin/

    HMMER doesn't depend on any external data files, so the installation is
    simple - the binaries are free standing, and you can install
    them anywhere you like.

For more detail, see the Installation chapter in the HMMER User's
Guide.

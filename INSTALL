HMMER is developed primarily on Linux systems. It is tested on a
variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, including Apple
OS/X. It is written in ANSI C99 conforming to POSIX standards. It
should build cleanly on any POSIX-compliant system with an ANSI C99
compiler, including UNIX and Macintosh systems.

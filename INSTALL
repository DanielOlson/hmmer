-------------------------------------------------------------

These are quick installation instructions. For complete documentation,
see the Installation chapter in the HMMER User's Guide (Userguide.pdf).

Starting from a source distribution, hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@.tar.gz:
 Uncompress:                uncompress hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@.tar.gz  
 Unpack:                    tar xf hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@.tar
 Move into new directory:   cd hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@
 Configure:                 ./configure
 Build:                     make
 Automated tests:           make check
 Automated install:         make install

For information on more expert customization options available to you
in the configuration and the Makefiles, see the Installation chapter
in the HMMER User's Guide (Userguide.pdf).

HMMER is developed primarily on Linux systems. It is tested on a
variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, including Apple
OS/X. It is written in ANSI C99 conforming to POSIX standards. It
should build cleanly on any POSIX-compliant system with an ANSI C99
compiler, including UNIX and Macintosh systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from a Subversion (SVN) working copy:

If you have checked HMMER out from its Subversion repository, there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory:

   ln -s easel/aclocal.m4 aclocal.m4
   autoconf
   (cd easel; autoconf)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Brief notes on different ways we configure HMMER during development:

for production:      ./configure CC=icc LDFLAGS="-static"
   icc (Intel C compiler) is best, for optimal performance

for debugging:       ./configure --enable-debugging

for profiling:       ./configure CFLAGS="-g -pg -O"
                     make
                     (run benchmark program; then gprof the program)

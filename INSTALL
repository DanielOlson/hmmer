on POSIX-compliant systems (including UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS/X).
HMMER will work on Windows if you install POSIX-compatibility software
such as Cygwin.

Starting from a Subversion (SVN) working copy:

If you have checked HMMER out from its Subversion repository, there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory:

   ln -s easel/aclocal.m4 aclocal.m4
   autoconf
   (cd easel; autoconf)

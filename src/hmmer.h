/* The RAMLIMIT determines the point at which we switch from fast,

/* Scores are kept internally as scaled integer log-odds scores:
 *     sc_x = INTSCALE * log_2 p_x / f_x, rounded off.
 * 
 * We use 32-bit signed integers to hold scores, giving a dynamic
 * range of -2.147e9 to 2.147e9. With INTSCALE at its default 
 * 1000, this means we hold scores of -2.1e6..2.1e6 bits, with
 * three digits of fractional precision.
 * 
 * We therefore need at least 11 characters width to guarantee
 * space for a raw, printed integer score; thus TXTLEN. See
 * p7_Score2ASCII() for use.
 * 
 * To deal with numerical underflow (in DP calculations, for example),
 * we define a threshold P7_IMPOSSIBLE for -infinity. We have to be
 * able to add two -infinities together without underflow, so we can
 * check the threshold and reset a result of an addition to our
 * internal -infinity.
 * 
 * In principle, one might attempt to store scores in less space
 * (particularly handy for taking advantage of fast graphics hardware,
 * which tend to provide vector instructions for 8-bit and 16-bit
 * quantities, but not always for 32-bit quantities).  16 bits only
 * gives us a range of +/-32767, though; HMMER scores range within
 * about +/-10000, and the three digits of fractional precision are
 * thought to be important, so we don't want to decrease INTSCALE.
 * It's just barely conceivable that you could use INTSCALE=100
 * and try to capture scores between -327.67 and 327.67; you'd have to deal 
 * with scores that underflow or overflow, though.

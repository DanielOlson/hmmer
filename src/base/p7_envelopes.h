/* P7_ENVELOPES:  information about domain locations on a target sequence
 * 
 * Also defines P7_ENVELOPE, singular. P7_ENVELOPE contains
 * information about one domain, whereas P7_ENVELOPES is a reusable,
 * memory managed container for an array of envelopes. Sometimes we
 * use a naked array of <P7_ENVELOPE> structures without the wrapper,
 * so a caller can either be passing <env->arr> from <P7_ENVELOPES> or
 * its own allocation of a <P7_ENVELOPE *> array. We have an evil
 * tendency to call both the array and the container <env> in the code,
 * because the meaning is unambiguous if you're alert to the context;
 * so beware the distinction between the singular and plural forms.

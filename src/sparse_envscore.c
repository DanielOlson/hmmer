/* Function:  p7_SparseEnvScore()
 * Synopsis:  Calculate an envelope Forward score.
 *
 * Purpose:   Calculate the score of an envelope <iae..ibe>, <kae..kbe>
 *            in the comparison of profile <gm> to sequence <dsq> of
 *            length <L>. That is, calculate the Forward score of this
 *            sequence as if it had only a single domain, constrained
 *            to lie within residues <iae..ibe> on the sequence and
 *            positions <kae..kbe> on the profile.
 *            
 *            Caller provides a sparse matrix <sx> for the
 *            calculation, initializaed the same way as a full sparse
 *            Forward calculation. We currently abuse this space for
 *            efficiency of the envelope calculation. Upon return, the
 *            contents of <sx> are undefined, except that it still
 *            retains its reference to a sparse mask <sx->sm>.
 *            
 *            The raw envelope score, in nats, is returned in
 *            <*ret_envsc>.
 *
 * Args:      dsq       - digital sequence, 1..L
 *            L         - length of dsq
 *            gm        - profile
 *            iae,ibe   - envelope coord bounds on sequence, 1<=iae<=ibe<=L
 *            kae,kbe   - envelope coord bounds on model, 1<=kae<=kbe<=M
 *            sx        - caller-allocated matrix for dsq x gm sparse comparison
 *            ret_envsc - RETURN: envelope score in nats
 *
 * Returns:   <eslOK> on success, and <*ret_envsc> is the envelope score.
 *
 * Throws:    (no abnormal error conditions)
 * 
 * Notes:  
 *   1. This is a modified version of sparse_fwdback.c::p7_SparseForward().
 *      The changes:
 *         - J state is ignored (treated as if tE->J=0). Even if the model
 *           <gm> is in multihit mode, envelope calculation is restricted
 *           to scoring a single domain.
 *         - 1..iae-1 are forced to be emitted by N; ibe+1..L are forced
 *           to be emitted by C.
 *         - Only sparse cells within <kae..kbe> envelope on each row are
 *           considered.
 *
 *   2. DP matrix <sx> has no structure other than being big enough
 *      for the entire sparse matrix for 1..L; therefore we know it is
 *      big enough for iae..ibe; so we just start immediately,
 *      rather than trying to position ourself at iae and leaving
 *      the correct # of initialized DP cells for 1..iae-1.
 *      We only store cells in the intersection of the sparse mask and 
 *      the envelope. 
 *      
 *   3. By construction of envelopes, we know iae..ibe must lie 
 *      within a single sparse segment. We do not have to check
 *      for rows with no included cells.

// AVX versions of functions used to manipulate P7_SPARSEMASK data structures

/* 
 * P7_SPARSEMASK and P7_SPARSEMX work together. P7_SPARSEMASK defines
 * which cells are included in the sparse DP matrix, and P7_SPARSEMX
 * is the matrix. The caller constructs a P7_SPARSEMASK first, then
 * uses it to create or reinitialize a P7_SPARSEMX, before running any
 * sparse DP routines (see sparse_fwdback.c).
 * 
 * For comparison see the reference DP implementation (p7_refmx.[ch],
 * reference_fwdback.c). Both the reference and the sparse DP
 * implementations work with a dual-mode profile <P7_PROFILE>, either
 * in the production code's back end (downstream of our fast vector
 * filters) or in testing.

 * 1. P7_SPARSEMASK; defines cells to be included in sparse DP matrix
 *****************************************************************/

/* Function:  p7_sparsemask_Create()
 * Synopsis:  Creates a new P7_SPARSEMASK object.
 *
 * Purpose:   Create a new <P7_SPARSEMASK> for a comparison of a profile
 *            of length <M> to a sequence of length <L>. Return a ptr to the
 *            new object.
 *
 *            The allocation will generally be for (much) less than <ML> cells;
 *            the API for creating the sparse mask will grow the structure
 *            appropriately. The structure does require at least $O(M)$ cells
 *            of temporary storage, in four "slots" used to sort input
 *            from striped vector code.  
 *
 * Args:      M       - model length
 *            L       - sequence length
 *
 * Returns:   a pointer to a new <P7_SPARSEMASK>
 *
 * Throws:    <NULL> on allocation failure.
 */

/* Function:  p7_sparsemask_StartRow()
 * Synopsis:  Prepare to store sparse cells on a new row i.
 *
 * Purpose:   Here we set up the vector "slots" (generally four of them,
 *            for vectors of four floats; the actual number is
 *            configured in <p7_VNF>) for temporarily storing sorted
 *            lists of k indices for each striped vector segment.
 *            Each slot must allow up to Q entries; so kmem must be
 *            allocated for at least ncells+p7_VNF*Q]. Reallocate
 *            <kmem> (by doubling) if needed. 
 * 
 *            Why do we need these shenanigans? The f/b filter uses
 *            striped vectors, which are not in the M..1 order that
 *            sparse DP needs. Temporary storage in four sorted slots,
 *            followed by their concatenation, is one way to rearrange
 *            efficiently. See note [3] in p7_sparsemx.h.
 *
 *            Remember, the whole <kmem> array is in reverse order during
 *            collection, so slot n[3] is first, n[0] is last; see note [3] in
 *            p7_sparsemx.h.
 *
 * Returns:   <eslOK> on success.
 *
 * Throws:    <eslEMEM> on reallocation failure. Now the contents of <sm> 
 *            are undefined, except that <_Destroy()> may be safely called 
 *            on it.
 *
 *            <eslEINVAL> on coding errors, failures of contract checks.

 *            in descending order <Q-1..0>. The <r>'s in a given vector

 *            indexing. For testing and debugging code, where we want
 *            to store normal k indices (as opposed to q,r vector
 *            coordinates), the magic is to convert k to simulated
 *            vector coords: that's <q = (k-1)%sm->Q>, <r =
 *            (k-1)/sm->Q>. Though that uglifies calls to this
 *            function from our test code, it's better to do such

 *            as production uses.

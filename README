------------------------------------------------------------------

HMMER searches biological sequence databases for homologous sequences,
using either single sequences or multiple sequence alignments as
queries. HMMER implements a technology called "profile hidden Markov
models" (profile HMMs). HMMER is used by many protein family domain
databases and large-scale annotation pipelines, including Pfam
(pfam.xfam.org) and other members of the InterPro Consortium
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).

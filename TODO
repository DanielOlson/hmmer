** Multiple sequence alignment file formats
   Define a short list of popular multiple alignment formats,
   and add i/o support for them in Easel.

* 

** Random number generators
   need to be seeded in predictable ways so searches give predictable
   results, even if they use stochastic sampling algorithms. 
   Make the --Rdet, --Rseed, --Rarb options work.


* Speed issues

** Port to GPUs 
   (we have a nVidia server and CUDA waiting)

** Port to Altivec/VMX 
   (see code in src/impl_vmx; follow impl_sse framework)

** Port to Cell processor 
   (see IBM donated code; see Michael Farrar's work)


* Small feature requests

** hmmscan (and other progs) should have --acc option, as hmmpfam did,
   for output of accessions instead of names. ("Hiroshi", 13 Jan 09)

#================================================================
# 1. Overview
#================================================================

We have a standard "unstable trunk" policy. The trunk is for
development.  Stable releases are branched and tagged.

The development trunk:
  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk

You can browse the entire repository, including all branches and tags,
by pointing your browser at:
  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer

HMMER depends on the Easel library, which is maintained in a separate
repository. Easel is also maintained under an "unstable trunk" policy.
Easel is linked to HMMER using svn:externals, meaning that Easel is
automatically checked out and updated (in the easel/ subdirectory)
when you check out or update HMMER. svn:externals does not propagate
commits to Easel; you have to (cd easel; svn commit) yourself to do
that.

The Easel development trunk:
  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk

The entire Easel repository:
  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel




#================================================================
# 2. Obtaining a fresh working copy of dev trunk
#================================================================

The first time you check out a copy of HMMER, there's a couple of
things you need to do besides the svn checkout.

  svn checkout https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk hmmer
  ln -s easel/aclocal.m4 aclocal.m4
  autoconf
  (cd easel; autoconf)

Now you can ./configure and make.


#================================================================
# 3. Using svn keywords and properties.
#================================================================

We have SVN stamp "URL" and "Id" strings in the LICENSE section of
most source files, including all .c and .h files.

- To set keyword replacement on a new module foo:
    svn propset svn:keywords "Id URL" foo.[ch]

- To see which keywords are set on a file foo.c:
    svn propget svn:keywords foo.c

- To use "find" to set keyword replacement on lots of files in one command:
    find . -name "Makefile.in" -exec svn propset svn:keywords "Id URL" {} \;



You need to set the executable property on scripts:
    svn propset svn:executable foo.pl
    svn propget svn:executable foo.pl


We use svn:externals to automatically pull Easel into a HMMER working
copy.

- Example of editing the svn:externals:
    svn propedit svn:externals hmmer

- Listing properties that are set:
    svn proplist foo



#================================================================
# 4. Creating a branch, keeping it in sync w/ trunk, re-merging
#================================================================

## Create a new branch "mybranch" in the repository.

 svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/mybranch\
    -m "Creating the mybranch branch"

## Check out a working copy in the directory you do your work (for me, ~/src/hmmer)

  cd ~/src/hmmer/branches
  svn checkout https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/mybranch mybranch

## Add an svn merge to your normal daily work cycle of svn update/svn commit 

  cd ~/src/hmmer/branches/mybranch
  svn update
  svn merge https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk
# resolve any conflicts and commit. Message might look like "sync: merged 3750..3758 trunk to branch"
  svn commit
# do your work
  svn commit


## When you're done, and ready to re-merge the branch back to the trunk:
# a final sync *from* the trunk  
  cd ~/src/hmmer/branches/mybranch
  svn update
  svn merge https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk
# test and commit
  make check
  svn commit
# now, in a *trunk* wd, merge the branch:
  cd ~/src/hmmer/trunk
  svn merge --reintegrate https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/mybranch
# test and commit
  make check
  svn commit
# After a --reintegrate, the branch is unusable. Delete it. (It's still remembered in the svn history, of course.)
  svn delete https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/mybranch -m "Deleting the mybranch branch; it has been merged to the trunk."

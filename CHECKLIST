Checklist for a HMMER distribution.

1. Make sure we're up to date w/ CVS. (Worry about commits here, on
   other machines and other dirs that may have squid modifications)
	% ./configure
        % make distclean
	% cvs update
	% cvs commit
   Clean up any stray files.

2. Test dev code before making release.
   This works anywhere (e.g. wren; don't have to be on wrasse)
   With and without memory leak tests ('make check' doesn't include -m flag)
   ccmalloc 0.3.9 is installed in /usr/local on wren and wrasse.
   Note: ccmalloc not threadsafe, so this doesn't test threads implementation.
   PVM isn't tested at all (yet).
    	% autoconf
	% (cd squid; autoconf)
     	% ./configure --enable-ccmalloc
        % make
	% (cd testsuite; ../ssdk/sqc -m -p ../squid 2 exercises.sqc . ../src)
	% make distclean
	% ./configure --enable-threads --enable-lfs
	% make
	% make check

3. Write release notes.
   cvs2cl.pl creates ChangeLog; a useful summary of CVS logs
	% ssdk/cvs2cl.pl    
        % emacs Release-Notes/RELEASE-${RELEASE}
	% cvs add Release-Notes/RELEASE-${RELEASE}

4. Update copyright, year, relcode, etc:
        configure.ac
	Licenses/gnu   (year only)

5. Commit to CVS. Include package and release # in the log message.
	% cvs commit

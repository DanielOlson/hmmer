When you check HMMER out from Subversion for the first time , there's
some additional stuff you need to do one-time-only in your new working
directory:

   ln -s easel/aclocal.m4 aclocal.m4
   autoconf
   (cd easel; autoconf)


Different ways of configuring HMMER during development:

for production:      ./configure CC=icc LDFLAGS="-static"
   icc (Intel C compiler) is best, for optimal performance

for debugging:       ./configure --enable-debugging

for profiling:       ./configure CFLAGS="-g -pg -O"
                     make
                     (run benchmark program; gprof program)
